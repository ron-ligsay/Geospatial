## The scientific method
and how  programming can make you a better scientist

1. Define a question
2. Gather information and resources (observe)
3. Form an explanatory hypothesis
4. Test the hypothesis by performing an experiment and collecting data in a reproducible manner
5. Analyze the data
6. Intercept the data and draw cocclusions that serve as a starting pint for new hypothesis
7. Publish results
8. Retest (frequently done by other scientiests)


## Developing a program
* Coming up with a specific list of instructions for the computer to follow in order to accomplish a desired task is not easy
* The following list will serve us as a general software development strategy
1. Analyze the problem
2. Determine specificationis
3. Create a design
4. Implememnt the design
5. Test/debug the program
6. Maintain the program (if necessary)
