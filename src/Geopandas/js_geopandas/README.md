## Shapefile
Shapefile is a popular geospatial vector data format for geographic information system (GIS) software. A shapefile is a simple, nontopological format for storing the geometric location and attribute information of geographic features. Shapefiles are composed of three files: a main file with a .shp extension, a file with a .shx extension, and a file with a .dbf extension. The main file stores the geometry and spatial location of the features, the .shx file stores the index of the main file, and the .dbf file stores attribute information of the features in the shapefile.
